Computer Sciences is now in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))!

## Support Group

All students are invited to join the rather informal support group [`polito_07jcj`](https://t.me/polito_07jcj) on [*Telegram*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)).

:exclamation: Python is being actively developed and few, yet important details may be different from what is described in the book.

### Online

The updated, official Python's documentation can be found at <[https://docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org)>.

The web is full of free, high-quality resources. This is an incomplete, already outdated list: you should look for something like **"PYTHON FREE BEGINNERS"** on your favorite search engine.
